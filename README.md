Manually cleaning out pocket is terrible :(

Create a client application on getpocket.com and create your oauth access 
token using the the pocket demo server: https://github.com/turadg/pocket-ruby/blob/master/demo-server.rb

Set the variables, run this script. Profit.

**Note this deletes all the things**
